/*
This program is meant to be a classroom management system. It gives the ability to the user to create a classroom object
which will hold information such as the instructors information, the students register to the classroom and their grades.
The user can add student, remove students, get a student's index, upgrade their grades, search students, compute their grade/score,
view their report card and view the class report card. The program keeps track of the number of students currently enrolled and checks whether 
it's full or not before allowing new students to be enrolled.
